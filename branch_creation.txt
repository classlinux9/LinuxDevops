To create a branch in Git, you can use the following commands:

1. Create a New Branch Locally
To create a branch without switching to it immediately:

bash
Copy code
git branch <branch-name>
To create a branch and switch to it at the same time:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b <branch-name>
or, with newer versions of Git:

bash
Copy code
git switch -c <branch-name>
2. Push the New Branch to the Remote Repository
Once you've created and switched to the new branch, push it to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub) with:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin <branch-name>
The -u option sets the remote branch as the upstream for the current branch, so future git push commands will automatically know where to push.
