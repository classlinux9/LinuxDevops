If a git pull doesn’t resolve the issue, let's try some additional steps to rebase your local branch onto the latest changes from the remote. This approach allows you to incorporate the remote changes without creating a merge commit.

1. Fetch the Latest Changes from the Remote
First, fetch the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them:

bash
Copy code
git fetch origin
2. Rebase Your Local Branch onto the Remote Branch
Rebasing will apply your local changes on top of the latest remote changes, keeping the commit history clean.

bash
Copy code
git rebase origin/main
If there are any conflicts during the rebase, Git will prompt you to resolve them. Once resolved, use:

bash
Copy code
git add <file-name>
Then, continue the rebase with:

bash
Copy code
git rebase --continue
If you want to abort the rebase and return to your previous state, use:

bash
Copy code
git rebase --abort
3. Push Your Changes to the Remote
After a successful rebase, push your changes:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
If the above still doesn’t work, it might be necessary to force the push. Use this carefully as it will overwrite the remote history:

bash
Copy code
git push -f origin main
Let me know if this helps, or if you see any specific error messages during these steps.
